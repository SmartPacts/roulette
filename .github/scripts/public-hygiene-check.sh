# public-hygiene-check.sh — the scrub that made this repository publishable, enforced on every
# push instead of once. A one-time removal decays: the next paragraph copied in from somewhere
# internal brings an identifier back and nobody notices.
#
# WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: it does not remove reasoning. Saying WHAT a guard prevents, and why, is the
# point of publishing. What it bans is internal bookkeeping an outside reader cannot resolve —
# decision-record numbers, review-round and finding numbers, private paths, custody and device
# identifiers, assistant trace — and any description of an engine weakness whose fix a reader
# cannot assume is deployed everywhere.
#
# 🔴 THE ONE EXCEPTION, AND WHY. pact/modules/roulette.pact and pact/modules/drand.pact are
# DEPLOYED VERBATIM: the code on chain is the `(module …)` form of those files, comments included,
# and VERIFY.md's whole claim is that they are identical. Scrubbing a comment out of either would
# break that claim while hiding nothing — those comments are already public on the chain, readable
# by anyone with `describe-module`. deploy-bytes/ is that same text, and the frozen-module fixture
# is roulette.pact with one substitution. All five are excluded BY EXACT PATH, never by a wildcard
# that could quietly cover a new file.
#
# 🔴 THE SECOND EXCEPTION, narrower. .github/scripts/pact-static-check.sh is the estate's generic
# Pact gate, shipped here with the same checks as the copy published at
# github.com/SmartPacts/prize-draw (only its header comment differs). Its own text names the
# release the weakness it warns about was fixed in. It is exempt from the engine-weakness pattern
# ONLY, and only at that exact path; changing its checks here would make this repository's gate
# differ from the published one for no gain.
