# WHAT IS COMPARED. `describe-module` returns the `(module …)` form exactly as the engine sliced
# it out of the deploy transaction's source — comments intact, nothing normalised, the namespace
# line and the create-table footer excluded. deploy-bytes/<module>.pact is that same slice, taken
# from the deploy transaction's own `cmd`. So this is a character-for-character equality, not a
# containment test and not a hash comparison.
#
# FAILS CLOSED. An empty or truncated fetch must never read as a pass, and a check that inspected
# nothing reporting PASS is worse than no check at all. So the size is asserted first, against the
# smallest thing each module could plausibly be.
