;; drand.pact — verify a drand BN254 beacon on chain (Pact 5 / KDA-CE).
;;
;; WHAT THIS IS FOR. A banked, fixed-odds game cannot take its outcome from a
;; Kadena block hash. The miner of the deciding block sees the outcome before
;; publishing and can discard the block and keep mining — a free re-roll. With
;; hashrate share h and true win probability b the grinder wins with
;;   W = b / (1 - h(1-b))
;; and four accounts produce 100% of mainnet blocks, the largest holding 61.5%.
;; An even-money bet then wins 71.1% instead of 48.65%. Measured, not modelled:
;; roulette-ops docs/measurements/BLOCK-HISTORY-AS-THE-BEACON.md.
;;
;; Combining several future blocks does NOT fix it — the first N-1 hashes already
;; exist when the last block is mined, so its miner evaluates the outcome exactly
;; as before. Deriving per player from the player's own committed secret does not
;; fix it either, because the attacker is a miner WHO IS ALSO A PLAYER. Both were
;; tested and both failed. What fixes it is entropy that no Kadena miner produces.
;;
;; THE PROPERTY THAT MATTERS is not the cryptography, it is RETRIEVABILITY. Pact
;; can read a Kadena block hash only in the very next block, which is why the
;; fleet's beacon has a one-block capture window and forfeits a round that misses
;; it. A drand round stays fetchable and verifiable FOREVER, so there is no window
;; to miss, no forfeit-on-missed-capture, and no gain from staying silent: anyone
;; may submit the beacon at any later time and a forged one cannot verify.
;;
;; NO HOUSE INPUT. The house holds no secret and sends no per-round transaction.
;; The standing constraint (founder, 2026-08-31: "the house is never a human
;; input") is preserved. Submitting a beacon is permissionless and unprivileged.
;;
;; THIS MODULE IS SEALED AND HAS NO STATE. Governance is (enforce false): it can
;; never be upgraded, so a consumer that pins it by code hash is pinning it
;; forever. It holds no tables, no capabilities and no funds, and every function
;; is pure — Pact has no private functions, so everything here is callable by
;; anyone, and that is harmless precisely because nothing here has an effect.
;;
;; FAIL-CLOSED. The pairing equation binds the signature to H(message). A mistake
;; in the hash-to-curve makes GENUINE signatures fail to verify; it cannot make a
;; forgery pass. The failure mode is "nothing settles", never "wrong winner" —
;; provided the point-at-infinity check stays, which is a named test.
;;
;; THE CONSTRUCTION, each element pinned by a mutation test that goes red if wrong:
;;   message  keccak256(I2OSP(round, 8))            -- Keccak-256, NOT SHA-256
;;   DST      BLS_SIG_BN254G1_XMD:KECCAK-256_SVDW_RO_NUL_   (43 bytes)
;;   expand   RFC 9380 s5.3.1 expand_msg_xmd, H = keccak256, s_in_bytes = 136
;;            (the Keccak rate — NOT 64, which is the usual copy-paste error)
;;   field    hash_to_field count 2, m 1, L 48
;;   map      Shallue-van de Woestijne RO variant: 2 maps then point-add.
;;            BN254 G1 has cofactor 1, so there is NO cofactor clearing and
;;            on-curve already implies in-subgroup.
;;   check    e(H(m), pk) * e(sig, -g2) == 1
;;   G2 ORDER drand serialises c1-first; Pact wants c0-first. This is the trap.
;;            It was settled against the twist equation, not assumed.
;;
;; GAS. One verify measured 1,082 best case / 1,965 worst (which SvdW branch the
;; two field elements take). BUT the gas table charges pairing as MilliGas using
;; the same integers Pact 4 charged as whole Gas, under a source comment saying
;; the costs need re-benching (TableGasModel.hs:98-105 vs :116). If KDA-CE
;; re-benches, one verify is ~21,000 gas. BUDGET 21k, not 1,965. Still 7x under.
;;
;; THE DEPENDENCY, stated plainly. This pins drand's `evmnet` chain and its public
;; key. drand cannot steer an outcome and cannot forge one; it can only stop
;; publishing. If that chain is ever retired, a consumer pinned to this module
;; must be redeployed — an admin-swappable beacon key is NOT the answer, because
;; whoever can swap the key can choose the outcome.
