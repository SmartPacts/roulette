// crank-keygen.mjs — create the crank's signing key ON THE MACHINE THAT WILL RUN IT, and refuse to
// overwrite one that already exists.
//
// Same shape as the prize-draw crank's keygen, for the same reasons: overwriting a funded key file
// loses control of whatever that account holds, permanently, so this never does it. The existence
// check is backed by an exclusive-create write ('wx'), which also fails if a file appears between
// the check and the write. The file is 0600 inside a 0700 directory. Only the PUBLIC key and the
// account are printed; the secret never leaves the file, and never appears in a log, a terminal
// scrollback or a message to anyone.
//
//   node crank-keygen.mjs /etc/roulette/crank-key.json
//
// It lives beside roulette-crank.mjs because it shares the crank's dependencies: run it from there.
//
// The file it writes is the FLAT shape `roulette-crank.mjs` reads — {account, publicKey, secretKey}
// at the top level, no persona wrapper — so the service runs with
//   ROULETTE_BOT_KEY=/etc/roulette/crank-key.json
//
// FUND IT AFTERWARDS. The account printed here holds nothing when it is created. Send it a small
// amount of KDA on the table's chain (chain 2) once the machine is set up — roulette-crank.mjs's
// header puts the whole duty at about 1 KDA a year on a busy table, the paying half of it 0.812
// KDA a year at 500 winners a day. Nothing else about this key is privileged: the crank holds no
// authority over any round, earns nothing, and every call it makes is one anybody could make.
