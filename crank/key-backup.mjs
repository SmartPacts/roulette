// key-backup.mjs — an encrypted, password-protected copy of this machine's signing key, and the
// drill that proves the copy works.
//
// WHY. The key is generated on this machine and never leaves it, which is what keeps it safe — and
// also what makes the machine a single point of failure. A dead disk takes the account's balance
// and everything it has earned with it, permanently: there is no seed phrase, no recovery, nothing
// to ask anyone for. This makes one file you can keep somewhere else.
//
//   node key-backup.mjs save    /etc/roulette/crank-key.json  crank-key.backup
//   node key-backup.mjs check   crank-key.backup
//   node key-backup.mjs restore crank-key.backup  /etc/roulette/crank-key.json
//
// `check` is the point. A backup nobody has restored is not a backup — it is a file you HOPE is a
// backup. `check` decrypts the blob in memory, derives the public key from the secret inside it,
// and confirms it matches the public key the blob names. It writes nothing and prints no secret,
// so you can run it any time, anywhere, including on the machine you are about to rebuild.
//
// WHAT IT NEVER DOES. It never prints a secret key, never takes the passphrase from the command
// line (arguments are visible to every process on the machine, and land in your shell history),
// and never writes a blob it has not just decrypted and compared. If the passphrase is lost the
// blob is gone — that is the trade, and it is the right way round: a backup anyone can read is
// worse than no backup, because it turns one stolen file into a stolen account.
//
// The crypto is Node's own, no dependencies: scrypt (N=2^16, r=8, p=1 — about 64 MB and a second
// of work per guess, which is what makes a human passphrase survive an offline attacker) and
// AES-256-GCM. The public key is stored in the clear and bound into the ciphertext as additional
// authenticated data, so you can tell two blobs apart without decrypting either, and neither can
// be passed off as the other.
